Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected.

Với cách giảng dạy đầy đủ, học viên có thể yên tâm về kiến thức nền tảng, vì bộ tài liệu này đã được xây dựng theo trình tự logic và hệ thống, đặc biệt là từ Chương I: Khái Quát Chung Về Bảo Hiểm — phần nền tảng cốt lõi của toàn bộ nội dung.\n\n### Chương I: Khái Quát Chung Về Bảo Hiểm\n\nChương I cung cấp một cái nhìn tổng quan về bảo hiểm, tập trung vào khái niệm “rủi ro” — một yếu tố trung tâm trong lĩnh vực này. Rủi ro được định nghĩa là “sự nguy hiểm bất trắc mà con người không lường trước được và là nguyên nhân dẫn đến tổn thất”. Để đối phó với rủi ro, con người đã và đang áp dụng hai nhóm biện pháp chính:\n\n#### Nhóm 1: Các biện pháp kiểm soát rủi ro (áp dụng trước khi rủi ro xảy ra)\n- **Tránh né rủi ro**: Không thực hiện các hành động quá mạo hiểm hoặc không chắc chắn. Mục đích là ngăn chặn rủi ro xảy ra, loại trừ nguy cơ tổn thất. Ưu điểm là hiệu quả nhất trong tình huống khẩn cấp, nhưng nhược điểm là khiến con người thụ động, mất cơ hội thành công, và không áp dụng được với mọi rủi ro (vì tránh rủi ro này có thể dẫn đến rủi ro khác).\n- **Đề phòng và hạn chế rủi ro**: Mục đích là giảm thiểu khả năng xảy ra rủi ro và hạn chế tổn thất. Có hai cơ chế tác động:\n  - **Xác suất xảy ra rủi ro (P)**: tối thiểu hóa khả năng xảy ra (ví dụ: lắp camera chống trộm).\n  - **Hậu quả của rủi ro (C)**: tối thiểu hóa tổn thất thiệt hại (ví dụ: lắp hệ thống chữa cháy, đội mũ bảo hiểm). Tuy nhiên, các biện pháp này không làm rủi ro biến mất hoàn toàn.\n\n#### Nhóm 2: Tài trợ rủi ro (áp dụng sau khi rủi ro xảy ra)\n- **Chấp nhận rủi ro**: Tự gánh chịu rủi ro bằng nguồn lực của chính mình (tự bảo hiểm). Với cá nhân và gia đình, tự bảo hiểm có thể là hình thức tiết kiệm; với doanh nghiệp, tổ chức kinh tế, cần lập quỹ dự trữ. Tuy nhiên, tự bảo hiểm có hạn chế: quy mô nhỏ → khó khắc phục rủi ro lớn, và có thể gây ứ đọng vốn.\n- **Chuyển nhượng rủi ro**: Phân tán rủi ro, chia nhỏ tổn thất. Ưu điểm là không gây ứ đọng vốn trong xã hội, phạm vi bù đắp rộng lớn, và có thể bù đắp rủi ro thảm họa. Tuy nhiên, hạn chế là khả năng tập hợp một lượng lớn người có cùng rủi ro là không đủ → khoản dự trữ chung không lớn, không đủ bù đắp.\n\n### Kết luận\n\nChương I không chỉ định nghĩa rủi ro mà còn cung cấp một hệ thống phân tích và giải pháp thực tiễn để quản lý rủi ro — từ việc kiểm soát trước, đến tài trợ sau. Đây là nền tảng quan trọng để học viên tiếp cận các nội dung nâng cao trong các chương tiếp theo, đồng thời giúp hiểu rõ vai trò và cơ chế của bảo hiểm trong đời sống và kinh tế.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] BH1.pdf",

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.
